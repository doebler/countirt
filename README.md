# countirt
 R package for count data IRT models.

This package implements the Two-Parameter Conway-Maxwell-Poisson (2PCMP) model as described here . It also implements the Two-Parameter Poisson Counts Model, as e.g. described here https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jocb.490. The package is currently under development and will be continously extended. So far, you can fit either model (including some constrained versions of these models) with the cirt function.
