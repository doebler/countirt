# countirt
 R package for count data IRT models.

This package implements the Two-Parameter Conway-Maxwell-Poisson (2PCMP) model as described here . It also implements the Two-Parameter Poisson Counts Model (2PPCM), as e.g. described here https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jocb.490. The package is currently under development and will be continously extended. So far, you can fit either model (including some constrained versions of these models) with the cirt function. Please consult the documentation of the cirt function.

In the future, vignettes and some examples will be provided here for how to use the countirt package.
