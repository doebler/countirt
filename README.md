# countirt
 R package for count data IRT models.

This package implements methods for count data Item Response Theory (IRT), specifically:

- the Two-Parameter Conway-Maxwell-Poisson model (2PCMPM; Beisemann, 2022)
- the Two-Parameter Poisson Counts Model (2PPCM; Myszkowski & Storme, 2021)
- the Distributional Regression Test Model (DRTM) and the Count Latent Regression Model (CLRM) which are explanatory count IRT models based on the 2PCMPM (Beisemann, Forthmann, & Doebler, 2022)
- the Poisson variants of the DRTM and the CLRM

This package is currently under development and will be continously extended. So far, you can fit all implemented models (including some constrained versions of these models) with the cirt function. Please consult the documentation of the cirt function.

You can install the package from GitHub e.g. using the devtools package with devtools::install_github("mbsmn/countirt"). Please note that the package includes C++ code which is tied into R using the Rcpp and RcppGSL packages. In C++, I use the GSL library. In order to be able to install and use the countirt package smoothly, you need to install GSL on your machine (this is not an R package, but a C/C++ library). If you have a Mac, you can do so e.g. with homebrew. There are tutorials online of how you can install the GSL library. You only need to have it, the rest should be taken care of by Rcpp and RcppGSL.

In the future, vignettes and some examples will be provided here for how to use the countirt package. Until then, you can have a look at the example script here (https://osf.io/dzcyt/) for some code using the countirt package.
